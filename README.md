# ISS-location-finder
## This project is used to locate where the iss is currently at. It also shows it's latitue, longitude and altitude too.
Here, I used leaflet and OpenStreetMap's API to show the current position of the ISS based on it's latitude and longitude. Also added some add on's such as displaying it's altitude, auto refreshing the page every second and hey my page auto change's it's background based on day and night. Cool right!

>This project was inspired by `The Coding Train` youtube channel all thanks to Daniel Shiffman.
